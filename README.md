# DS-projects-archive

This repository serves as an archive of various data analysis projects I have worked on. It includes projects from online platforms such as **Kaggle**, **Alibaba Cloud Tianchi**, and **BigQuery**, as well as take-home assignments completed as part of **job application processes**.

These projects reflect my experience in exploring real-world datasets, performing statistical analysis, building visualizations, and communicating insights clearly. Each folder typically contains the code, processed data (if applicable), and final outputs or reports in HTML/PDF formats.
